# Intelligent DC Motor Control System using Arduino Uno

This project demonstrates a sensor-driven motor control system using Arduino, simulating basic intelligent behavior. It responds to environmental data (via IR sensors) to control a DC motor in real time. The goal is to bridge embedded system automation with the principles of AI/ML-driven robotics.

Built with:
- Arduino Uno
- IR Sensors
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motor
- PWM Logic

Future Scope:
Integration with TinyML (TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers) to implement AI-based decision-making on low-power devices.
